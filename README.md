# US Accidents

## Context

This project aims to develop a accident severity classifier based of several technical parameters. To achieve this goal, multiple models were implement, like Decision Tree, Random Forest, SVM (Support Vector Machine) and ANN (Artificial Neural Network).

Unfortunately, GitHub does not render the graphs from Plotly, used in the US_Accidents notebook, and does not allows the storage of the non-compressed original file. To visualize it adequately, please open it on [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1jxdVePg0jQYKV6LU4Wn7TVaKNrjg2g1_?usp=sharing).

## Dataset

This project is based on the data available on the [US Accidentes Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/sobhanmoosavi/us-accidents), found on Kaggle.
